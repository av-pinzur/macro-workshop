# Danger Zone

## Multiple evaluation

1. Multiple evaluation isn't always a bug. In fact, in many cases it's the
   fundamental reason for a macro existing. Give a couple of example macros in
   clojure.core that may evaluate one or more of their input expressions
   multiple times.

2. Look back at your solutions to the exercises so far, and see whether you've
   got any multiple evaluation problems. Looking for an unquote in front of the
   same symbol in multiple places is usually a good clue.

3. Why is it that we "Can't take value of a macro"? Is it a Clojure compiler limitation?
   Or something more fundamental?

4. Isn't there some trick we can do to avoid using a macro to implement
   `log-row`?  (assuming you still need to build on top of `log`)

    ```clojure
    (defmacro log [& args]
     `(println (str "[INFO] " (string/join " | " ~(vec args)))))

    (log-row ["column one" "column two" "column three"])
    ```

   How? (or, alternatively, why isn't it possible?) Hint: could the fact that
   we have `eval` help? There is a failing test in
   `spec/macro_workshop/apply_macro_spec.clj`. Can you make it pass?

   ```bash
   lein spec -a spec/macro_workshop/apply_macro_spec.clj
   ```
